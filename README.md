# Gregory

This is Gregory. Gregory controls repos. Gregory keeps track of updating repos, trying to be simple and elegant, but enough.

## Documentation

Go look at [`docs/`](/docs/), and check out the [example config](/gregory.example.toml)

## TODO

- Add multithreading
- Add hook system

## Other stuff

- The formatting for the config file (`gregory.toml`) was heavily inspired by Drone's config.
- Why the name?
  - I was thinking to go with something dark and foreboding, since this is a program to control *everything* about a repo - it's the high command. But I couldn't think of anything and thought just naming it some lame random name instead would be way funnier. Hence, Gregory.
- Gregory is a program, so it uses it/its pronouns. It also doesn't mind whether you capitalize its name or not, "gregory" or "Gregory" are fine, you can even shorten it if you want.
- It's built for updating package repositories, but can be used to run pretty much anything. This isn't to say support won't be offered unless you're using it for a repo, but development will be focused on updating repos.
