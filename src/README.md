# Gregory

This is Gregory. Gregory controls repos. Gregory keeps track of updating repos, trying to be simple and elegant, but enough.

## TODO

- Add sources (similar to `sources` in a PKGBUILD)?
- Add support for loading scripts rather than listing commands
- Add multithreading
- Add better/custom grouping for when to run jobs (dependency system?)

## Other stuff

- The formatting for the config file (`gregory.yml`) was heavily inspired by Drone's config.
- Why the name?

I was thinking to go with something dark and foreboding, since this is a program to control *everything* about a repo - it's the high command. But I couldn't think of anything and thought just naming it some lame random name instead would be way funnier. Hence, Gregory.
