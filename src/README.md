# Gregory

This is Gregory. Gregory controls repos. He keeps track of building packages for repos, and can also have steps added to update those repos, or whatever you want him to do.

<small>Okay that's enough of talking about Gregory as a person.</small>

## Why the name?

I was thinking to go with something dark and foreboding, since this is a program to control *everything* about a repo - it's the high command. But I couldn't think of anything and thought just naming it some lame random name instead would be way funnier. Hence, Gregory.
